## What is this book about?
Drupal 8 comes with a release cycle that allows for new functionality to be added at a much faster pace.

* Develop Drupal 8 modules that do all the things you want 
* Master numerous Drupal 8 sub-systems and APIs in the process 
* Model, store, manipulate and process data to serve your purposes 
* Display data and content in a clean and secure way using the Drupal 8 theme system 
* Test your business logic to prevent regressions 
* Stay ahead of the curve and write code following the current best practices
